 Convert Number Into Words




1) First it creates arrays.One should contain word representation of numbers from 1 to 19.
2) Another array should contain word representation ofmultiples of 10 up to 90.
3) It will check the length of the number. 
4) It creates a function that takes a number and returns its word representation.
5) Inside the function, if the number is greater than or equalto 1000, divide the number with 1000, add "thousand" to the word representation.
6) This is the repeated procedure
7) If the next number is greater than or equal to 100, divide the number with 100, add "hundred" to the word representation.
8) If the remainder is greater than 0, add the word "and" to the word representation.
9) If the remainder is greater than or equal to 20, divide the remainder by 10 and add the word representation of the quotient from the second array.
10) If the remainder of the division in step 11 is greater than 0, add the word representation of the remainder from the first array.
