          Convert Number Into Words

Convert Number Into Words

1) first we have to take a input through calling function and function receives that input
2) and we take 2 arrays one is included 1 to 9 numbers with Words another array included 11 to 20 and 30, 40 
   .....90 with words.

3) we wil check the input number with the if conditions
   a) if the number is < 10 it returns the assigned value from array 1
   b)  if the number is < 20 it returns the assigned value from array 2
   c) if the number is < 100 we should divide the input number with 10 If the remainder is greater than
   Zero. Then subtract the remainder from input value then check the both reminder and subtracted 
   values from arrays and return result with concatenation.
   else  it returns the assigned value from array 2
   d) if the number is < 1000 we should divide the input number with 100 If the remainder is greater 
   than Zero. Then return and subtract the remainder from input value then divide again with 100 now, 
   check that result value with the arrays and return hundredth value then send the remainder value to 
   the same function again(recursion process).
   else  it returns the assigned value from array 1
4) if the input value is greater than 1000 then directly go to return statement with related output.
5) After these, it will exit the function and go to print the statement with the result.
